Hi there! :wave: I'm a **computer vision researcher** dedicated to advancing **autonomous driving** :oncoming_automobile: in complex outdoor environments.

Since the start of my career, I've been hands-on with every stage of vision-based system development :camera:, **from image capture to deployment**. My previous experience **leading a team** through challenging R&D projects has given me the opportunity to work at the intersection of AI :robot: and real-world applications.

Currently pursuing a **PhD** :student: and working as a researcher at **Rey Juan Carlos University**, I'm always on the lookout for new ways to create impactful technology.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll often find me **exploring nature** :owl: or diving into the latest AI trends!
